    <h3>River Walk - Saturday Evening, July 26th</h3>
    <p>
    After the reception, we hope you'll enjoy downtown San Antonio.
    See the Alamo, the River Walk and visit La Villita.
    Get a view of the whole city from the Tower of Americas, and have a drink or a snack at the bar to avoid paying for the elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="http://visitsanantonio.com/english/tripideas">This website</a> offers many other ideas.
    Nithya and Michael will venture out in the cool evening for a stroll on the River Walk, dinner, and finally mango ice cream at the Menger.
    You're free to explore on your own or join us.

    <h3>Bike Ride - Sunday Morning, July 27th</h3>
    <p>
    Sunday morning join us for a bike ride to Mission Conception.
    <b>We’ll be starting at 7:30am</b> to enjoy the cool weather and will be using <a href="https://sanantonio.bcycle.com/" target="_new">San Antonio B-Cycle</a>.
    You can either bring your own helmet or check one out at the <b>Central Hub location in Hemisfair Park</b> during regular business hours.
    </p>
    <p>
    We will start our 3 mile ride to Mission Conception at the bike “Share station” near the southwest corner of “Hemisfair Plaza” at the intersection of Alamo Street and Cesar Chavez street.
    You can rent bikes there, or at any “B-Cycle Share Station” you see on the way there.
    At the Share Station at Mission Conception, we will refuel with snacks and drinks.
    Interested people may briefly walk around the Mission and also see an interesting travertine outcrop.
    The Mission asks that we finish by 9:15am when they begin to fill up for their Sunday morning Mass.
    </p>
    <p>
    We will then bike back to Hemisfair Plaza to return the bikes.
    We estimate that the trip will cost $18/person.
    </p>
