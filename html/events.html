  <h3>Bike Ride - Sunday Morning, July 27th</h3>
  <p>
  Sunday morning join us for a bike ride to Mission Conception.
  <b>We’ll be starting at 8am</b>, to enjoy the cool weather and will be using <a href="https://sanantonio.bcycle.com/">San Antonio Bicycles</a>.
  You can either bring your own helmet or check one out at the <b>Central Hub location in Hemisfair Park</b> during regular business hours.
  </p>
  <p>
  We will start our 3 mile ride to Mission Conception at the bike “Share station” near the southwest corner of “Hemisfair Plaza” at the intersection of Alamo Street and Cesar Chavez street.
  You can rent bikes there, or at any “B-Cycle Share Station” you see on the way there.
  At the Share Station at Mission Conception, we will refuel with snacks and drinks.
  Interested people may briefly walk around the Mission and also see an interesting travertine outcrop.
  The Mission asks that we finish by 9:15am when they begin to fill up for their Sunday morning Mass.
  </p>
  <p>
  We will then bike back to Hemisfair Plaza to return the bikes.
  The bikes cost $10 to rent for 24 hours and $2 for every 30 minutes.
  We estimate that the trip will cost $16/person.
