  The ultimate gift we can receive is your presence at our wedding as well as your love and support for this journey we are about to embark.
  We recognize that especially for those of you coming from far away, simply attending our wedding will already entail spending money on travel and hotel accommodations.
  We are fortunate enough to have most of the customary items needed to start a home.
